### Knowledge graph completion
* NOIGAN: NOISE AWARE KNOWLEDGE GRAPH EMBEDDING WITH GAN
  - Proposed a unified GAN framework to jointly combine the two tasks, knowledge graph completion by embedding model and error detection.
  - Experimented on FB15K, YOGA3-10, WN18 with noisy triples that are made by randomly substituting the head entity or the tail entity.
* On Understanding Knowledge Graph Representation
  - Assume that knowledge graph embeddings have similar properties to word embeddings.
* Conversation Generation with ConceptFlow
  - Similar idea to my paper DyKgChat, but using graph neural network and focusing on 2-hops as maximum.
  - Experimented on Commonsense Conversation Dataset, primarily used overlapping metrics for evaluation.
