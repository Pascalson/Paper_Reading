* NOIGAN: NOISE AWARE KNOWLEDGE GRAPH EMBEDDING WITH GAN
  - Proposed a unified GAN framework to jointly combine the two tasks, knowledge graph completion by embedding model and error detection.
  - Experimented on FB15K, YOGA3-10, WN18 with noisy triples that are made by randomly substituting the head entity or the tail entity.
